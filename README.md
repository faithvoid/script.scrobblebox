# ScrobbleBox - an offline Rockbox scrobble logger for XBMC4Xbox
A simple XBMC4Xbox addon that logs scrobbled songs to a "scrobbler.log" file, like Rockbox does. Pairs well with [rb-scrobbler](https://github.com/jeselnik/rb-scrobbler)

## How to use:
- Install ScrobbleBox to your scripts folder in XBMC4Xbox
- Run in the background, listen to music and enjoy! (All tracks are automatically scrobbled after reaching at least the halfway point!)
- To upload scrobbles, grab your scrobbles from "scrobbler.log" from your Q directory and use a program such as rb-scrobbler to upload it!
