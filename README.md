# ScrobbleBox - an offline Rockbox scrobble logger for XBMC4Xbox
Pairs well with [rb-scrobbler](https://github.com/jeselnik/rb-scrobbler)

## How to use:
- Install ScrobbleBox to your scripts folder in XBMC4Xbox
- Run in the background, listen to music and enjoy! (All tracks are automatically scrobbled after reaching at least the halfway point!)
