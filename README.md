# ScrobbleBox - an offline Rockbox scrobble logger for XBMC4Xbox
A simple XBMC4Xbox addon that logs scrobbled songs to a "scrobbler.log" file, like Rockbox does. Pairs well with [rb-scrobbler](https://github.com/jeselnik/rb-scrobbler)

## How to use:
- Install ScrobbleBox to your scripts folder in XBMC4Xbox
- Run ScrobbleBox, select "Start ScrobbleBox", listen to music and enjoy as ScrobbleBox scrobbles in the background! (All tracks are automatically scrobbled after reaching at least the halfway point!)
- To enable/disable ScrobbleBox on startup, you can do so from the main ScrobbleBox menu!
- To upload scrobbles, grab your scrobbles from "scrobbler.log" from your Q directory and use a program such as rb-scrobbler to upload it! (uploading directly to last.fm/libre.fm is TBA)

## TODO:
- Allow enabling/disabling of ScrobbleBox's script.
- Allow upload to either last.fm or libre.fm (or at least to a host PC)
